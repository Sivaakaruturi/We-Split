# We Split â€“ SwiftUI Tip Calculator App ðŸ’¸

A simple and elegant tip-splitting app built with **SwiftUI**, allowing users to:

- Enter the check amount
- Choose how many people to split the bill with
- Select a tip percentage
- View both the **total amount** and **amount per person**

This project helps reinforce SwiftUI concepts like:
- `@State` for data binding
- `TextField` for currency input
- `Picker` with dynamic ranges
- Computed properties for real-time calculations
- Focus management with `@FocusState`
- `NavigationStack` and `Form` UI structures
